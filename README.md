# Keep an eye on OVH's webpages!

This tool has been written in order to keep an eye on OVH's website.

This is a simple solution, only a little-engineered, but it __does__ its job.

What does it do?

Simple, it keeps watching some webpages you choose. When something changes in that page, you're sent an sms through Skype.

Skype **must** be running on your system, and Skype4Py libraries must be installed as well.

On the Perl side, this thing is based on WWW::Mechanize.
